Extents are not enabled.  The file extent tree can be checksummed, whereas block maps cannot.  Not enabling extents reduces the coverage of metadata checksumming.  Pass -O extents to rectify.
64-bit filesystem support is not enabled.  The larger fields afforded by this feature enable full-strength checksumming.  Pass -O 64bit to rectify.
